# vjt Homebrew Formulas

This a [brew](https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew) [tap](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme) repository containing a collection of "formulae" for assorted software I use.

## Usage

You can add this tap to your Brew and then install my formulae directly using `brew install`:

    brew tap vjt/formulas

Otherwise, if you are interested only in a single formula of the ones below, you can install it directly:

    brew install vjt/formulas/NAME

Now you will be able to work on those formulae as if there were in canonical Homebrew repository:

## Formulae

#### @vjt/homebrew-update-notifier ([:octocat:](https://github.com/vjt/homebrew-update-notifier))

Announce outdated Homebrew formulas in the OS X Notification Center.

    brew install vjt/formulas/homebrew-update-notifier
